# Chat App

---

A modern real-time chat application built with a clean user interface  
and a reliable backend. The goal of this project is to keep the system  
simple, readable, and scalable while covering real-world chat features.

This is a practical full-stack implementation focused on clarity and  
long-term maintainability rather than unnecessary abstractions.
